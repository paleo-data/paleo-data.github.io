# Zenodo resource data file template
#
# Most metadata used to depict Zenodo resources on the hub is loaded from the
# Zenodo API when the site is generated. The subset of data provided here is used
# to identify, annotate, and place the resource within the hub.
#
# The data file must be copied to the _data/resources folder to be added to the site.
#
# The filename should include the author and publication year of the resource. 
# Filenames should be lowercase with individual words and number delimited by hyphens.
# Years may include an alphabetic suffix if necessary to distinguish publications with
# the same authors and year.

# Examples:
#
# - One author: smith-2021.yml
# - Two authors: smith-and-thomas-2023.yml
# - Three or more authors: smith-et-al-2022.yml

# - Multiple publications from the same year: smith-2021a.yml, smith-2021b.yml
