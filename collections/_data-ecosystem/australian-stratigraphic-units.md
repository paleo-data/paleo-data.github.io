The [Australian Stratigraphic Units Database](https://www.ga.gov.au/data-pubs/datastandards/stratigraphic-units) is a resource that covers lithostratigraphy of Australia and Antarctica and some associated references/publications. It is maintained by the Commonwealth of Australia (Geoscience Australia), and is an authoritative source for names and information about lithostratigraphic units in Australia.

From website: The Australian Stratigraphic Units Database (ASUD) originated as the National Register of Stratigraphic Names in 1949. The register was originally set up to help geoscientists adhere to the (then) newly created Australian Code of Stratigraphic Nomenclature (Lenz, et al, 1996). All information was held in a card file system until 1979 when the database was first developed electronically. Some of the card files were transferred to the database, but there is still legacy data held only in the card files. This may be relevant when reviewing very long-standing units.
The database now records information on all Australian stratigraphic units and their usage in literature, making it a centralised reference point for all Australian stratigraphic unit information. The database is also the repository for definition descriptions for these units.

**TIP**
For many digital databases and digital geological maps, the database can act as an authority table with the potential to automatically provide current information on the related parentage, age and province.
