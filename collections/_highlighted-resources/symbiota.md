## What is Symbiota?

{% include resource_link filename='symbiota.yml' %} is open source software guided by the Darwin Core data standard used to create data portals to help collections share and manage biodiversity data. While Symbiota has been widely used to share data from biological collections, support for the active management and publication of fossil specimen data is relatively new (NSF Awards #[2324690](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2324690)/[2525603](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2525603)). The most commonly used version of Symbiota and a number of Symbiota-based portals are maintained by the [Symbiota Support Hub](https://symbiota.org/about-us) (SSH).

## What is the "Paleo Data Portal"?
The {% include resource_link filename='pdp.yml' %} is a Symbiota-based data portal that exists to:
- Provide a **low barrier-to-entry** data mobilization platform for fossil collections
- **Increase access** to fossil specimen data for research use
- **Build community** among fossil collections not previously engaged in digitization efforts
- **Integrate with [PDWG](/community/about-pdwg)â€™s efforts** to develop best practices in paleo data management and publishing
- Provide a **platform for testing solutions** to outstanding issues associated with fossil specimen data (e.g. taxonomy, see {% include resource_link filename='little-et-al-2023.yml' %})

While the PDP is hosted by the SSH, the portal's [Steering Committee](https://paleo.symbiota.org/portal/misc/contacts.php) provides guidance on best practices related to the management of fossil specimen data.

Critically, **the Paleo Data Portal integrates with the goals of a larger project** led by the University of Colorado at Boulder, the US National Museum of Natural History, and the University of Kansas' Symbiota Support Hub that aims to 1) support transformational and translational research in the geo- and biosciences by driving development in the open data landscape and 2) improve the discoverability and use of paleontological specimen data through community engagement and collaboration.

## How to participate
If you administer a fossil collection and would like to use the PDP to manage your specimen data, first carefully review the portal's [community guidelines](https://paleo.symbiota.org/portal/includes/usagepolicy.php) as well as the Symbiota-related content on this website. If Symbiota seems suitable for your data management needs after considering this information, please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/VGH9Rqg4ujpNcj1C8) if you would like to contribute data to the PDP. Data providers are **strongly** encouraged to participate in the [Paleo Data Working Group](/community/about-pdwg).
