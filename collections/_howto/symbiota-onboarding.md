This guide will walk you through the steps you need to get started using the [Symbiota Paleo Data Portal](https://paleo.symbiota.org) for collections management. You may also want to familiarize yourself with the information in the [community]() section of this site.

## What is Symbiota?

Symbiota is **open source software** for creating **themed data portals** that help people **share** and **actively manage** biodiversity data. It is largely guided by the [Darwin Core]() data standard.

> Check out the [main Symbiota source code on GitHub](https://>github.com/BioKIC/Symbiota). As an open source codebase, Symbiota is being developed concurrently by [several organizations](https://symbiota.org/related-projects/).

### Portal communities

Themed portals are typically supported by a community of users coalesced around common goals related to digitization and/or data mobilization. These goals may be taxonomic, geographic, institutional, or project-based. Since 2012, over 20 [Thematic Collections Networks (TCNs)](http://idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/TCN_Resources) have used Symbiota as part of their digitization work. Most of these networks focus on neontological specimens, with the exception of the [Pteridological Collections Consortium](https://pteridophytes.berkeley.edu/).

### Symbiota Support Hub (SSH)

The Symbiota Support Hub (SSH) was established in 2021 in order to provide:
- **Help Desk support** for portal data access, publication, sharing, and management (help@symbiota.org) 
- Scalable development, management, and dissemination of **documentation** for all categories of Symbiota users (biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs) 
- Implementation of a **sustainable business plan** for the SSH
- **Hosting webinars, trainings, and workshops to improve capacity within the Symbiota user community**

SSH is funding by the National Science Foundation ([award 2027654](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2027654)) through 2026.

## What is the Paleo Data Portal?

*INSERT CONTENT ABOUT GEO OSE GRANT*

The Paleo Data Portal is hosted by the Symbiota Support Hub and aims to:
- Provide **low barrier-to-entry** data mobilization platform
- Increase **data accessibility** for research use
- **Build community** with and among fossil collections not previously engaged in digitization efforts
- **Integrate with [PDWG]()’s efforts** to develop best practices in paleo data management and publishing
- Provide a **testing ground** for technical solutions, e.g. those related to taxonomy

## Using the Paleo Data Portal for collections management

This guide will provide an introduction to the portal's essential functions fo data providers, including information about how to...
- Access your collection’s dataset
  - View the various control panels
  - Grant/redact user permissions/access
  - Manage your collections metadata
  - Backup your data
- Add/edit records
- Manage taxonomy
- Publish your data

### Accessing your dataset

Your dataset, or "collection profile," can be found by going to *Sign in > My Profile > Occurrence Management*. Here you will see two panels: (1) Data Editor Control Panel and (2) Administration Control Panel. **Data Editor** enables activities typically completed by volunteers, interns, and other individuals who do not need full administrative access. **Administration** is only visible to users with admin access, e.g. collections managers, curators, etc.

### Managing users

In the **Administration Control Panel**,
