# This document is used to automatically populate tooltip definitions for terms used in site content. Terms that belong here include general concepts and common acronyms. For the most part, information about specific projects and resources should be curated as files in the _data/resources directory. Exceptions include resources which are commonly mention by their acronym, e.g. PBDB or WoRMS.
